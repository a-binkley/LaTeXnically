# LaTeXnically

## A tool designed to help students in CIS 160 / CIT 592 / New LaTeX users

Spending hours trying to draw the perfect symbol in Detexify? Banging your head against the wall reviewing lecture slides to find one specific LaTeX function that was used? Look no further! LaTeXnically is designed to let you easily translate math equations, set builder notation, and other Graph/Set Theory concepts to LaTeX without the headache. Simply type or click to select the input text, and we'll give you the exact LaTeX code you need! If you're ever stuck or need to double check anything, there's also a built-in documentation for all LaTeX commands covered in the course.

## Features

### Click-to-Add Symbols

Clicking the buttons sends the corresponding literal character(s) to the text input area. Hover for button description.

### LaTeX Translator

Takes in literal characters from keyboard and buttons and outputs characters in LaTeX code

```
Input: 
`{∀x ∈ ℤ | x ≤ |x|}`

Output: 
`\{ \forall x \in \mathbb{Z} | x \leq |x|\} `
```

### Copy to Clipboard

Copy the translation to be pasted in a convenient link to your Overleaf account or wherever desired.
